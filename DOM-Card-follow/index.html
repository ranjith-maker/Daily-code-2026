<!-- flex-direction only affects a flex container’s direct children, not grandchildren.

So:

#card { flex-direction: column; }
→ affects only the direct children of #card

.btns { display: flex; }
→ affects only the buttons inside .btns
These two flexboxes are independent.

All display layout properties affect the child only 
Amazing insight, we know that buttons'll come inside card,not oly that but img, h1s, button, all the elements we add 
we made  for card as we want elements to come one by one, interesting thisng is we'ev 2 buttons and we want both the buttons to come side by side, flex-direction: column;
it isn't possible, that's when we got to know this, flex-direction: column; only affects the direct child not the grandchild thts why we made a grandchild by putting a buttons in a div    
now ok!


Specificity comparison

#card button → 1 ID + 1 element

#remove → 1 ID

👉 #card button is actually MORE specific than #remove

Specificity values:

#card button → (1,1,0)
#remove       → (1,0,0)

#card #remove → (2,0,0)  ✅ wins
